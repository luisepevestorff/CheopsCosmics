# Characterising the South Atlantic Anomaly with CHEOPS
This code is used to identify and count cosmic ray hits on CHEOPS' CCD. Alongside the number of identified cosmic rays, the cosmic ray density and percentage of pixels affected by cosmic rays are used in addition to the geographical position of the spacecraft to study the evolution of the SAA and the auroral zones.

This was developed by Alexis Heitzmann and Luise Pevestorff.
